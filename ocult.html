     <h3>The Church's Control of the Female Body</h3>
     <p>
      The teachings of the Church for centuries were clear: a woman's sexuality should only exist within marriage and for the purpose of 
      bearing children. Any form of pleasure outside of this, especially masturbation, was seen as rebellion against God's order. There were also beliefs
    that masturbation "opened the gates" to demonic influence, since the woman gave in to the desires of the flesh without male control.

     <h3>Link to Witchcraft and Sin</h3>
     <p>
     During the Middle Ages and onwards, female sexuality was associated with sin and dark forces. Women who showed pleasure or masturbated
     could be suspected of having contact with the devil. In witch trials, sexual activity with evil spirits was often cited as "proof" 
     of the woman's guilt. Masturbation was not only seen as sinful – it could be interpreted as a sign that the woman had connections with the occult.

        <p>hysteria
         During the 19th century, female masturbation was thought to cause "hysteria," a condition linked to the woman's uterus. Doctors believed that
         women who masturbated could become mentally unstable, depressed 
         or even crazy. This led to treatments such as vibrator therapy, cold baths, or in the worst case, removal of the clitoris 
         all to stop "morbid" masturbation. It was therefore not only taboo, but was considered a medical and moral danger.

    <p><span class="sbl">what is occultism?</span> <br>

        Occultism encompasses the study of secret and spiritual knowledge, often outside traditional religious and scientific frameworks. It may include:
        <br>
        <br>
       <span class="bl"> Magical rituals </span>– The use of symbols, spells and ceremonies.
        <br>
        <br>
       <span class="bl">Astrology & numerology</span> – Seeking answers through the positions of the stars and the meanings of numbers.
        <br>
        <br>
       <span class="bl">Hermeticism & alchemy </span>– Philosophical and mystical traditions of transformation and enlightenment.
        <br>
        <br>
       <span class="bl">Spiritism & spiritualism </span>– Communication with other dimensions through mediums and séances.

        Some see occultism as a path to insight and self-development, while others warn of its dangers. Historically, many occult traditions have been persecuted, while secretly continuing to influence philosophy, art, and religion.
        
        <span class="sl">O</span>ne aspect of occultism intersects with the perception of female sexuality, particularly in the context of historical views on women's bodies. <span class="sl">I</span>n ancient times, female sexuality was seen as both a source of life and spiritual energy but also something dangerous, needing to be controlled. <span class="sl">W</span>omen's bodies, and by extension their pleasure, were often demonized and labeled as "witchcraft" during periods like the witch trials of the Middle Ages. <span class="sl">T</span>he Catholic Church and patriarchal systems feared women who embraced their own pleasure, as it symbolized independence and autonomy.
        
         <span class="sl">Y</span>et, in secret mystical traditions—among mystics, pagans, and tantrics—the female orgasm was understood as a spiritual tool, a source of energy and creative force leading to enlightenment. This ancient wisdom, hidden over time in suppressed writings and symbols, has recently resurfaced.

        Today, women are reclaiming their sexuality, just as the witches once did. By exploring their bodies and embracing pleasure, they break free from ancient chains and reconnect with their innate power. What was once called "witchcraft" is, in truth, an ancient wisdom: female pleasure is magic.

What was once called "witchcraft" is, in truth, an ancient wisdom: female pleasure is magic.

        This magic is not loud or theatrical—it’s quiet, cyclical, and deeply personal. It pulses in moonlit rituals, in breathwork and movement, in honest conversations between women who refuse to be silenced. It lives in books once hidden, in herbs once outlawed, and in stories passed from grandmother to granddaughter, whispered like spells.
